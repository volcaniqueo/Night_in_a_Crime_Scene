# Night_in_a_Crime_Scene
This project was my 6th Homework for the course CMPE 150 (Introduction to Computing) at Bogazici University. The problem is basically integer Knapsack-like problem.
## About the Project
In this project I solved an integer Knapsack-like problem with considering all the subsets that satisfies given conditions. The complexity of the algorithm is theta (2^n). Although the complexity is really bad, there is no known better solution to the integer Knapsack problem.
## To Run the Code
```python3 CMPE150_HW6_volcaniqueo.py```
